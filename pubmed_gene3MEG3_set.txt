AB  - Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located on 
      chromosome 14q32.3. Direct sequencing experiments have shown monoallelic expression 
      of this lncRNA. Several studies have shown down-regulation of this lncRNA in human 
      cancers. In some cases, hypermethylation of the promoter region has been suggested 
      as the underlying mechanism. Functional studies have shown that this lncRNA controls 
      expression of several tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes among them are p53, RB, 
      MYC and TGF-β. Through regulation of Wnt-β-catenin pathway, it also affects 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In vitro studies have demonstrated contribution 
      of MEG3 in defining response to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel, 
      cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Certain polymorphisms within MEG3 are implicated in 
      cancer risk (rs7158663, rs4081134 and rs11160608) or therapeutic response of cancer 
      patients (rs10132552). Taken together, this lncRNA is regarded as a putative cancer 
      biomarker and treatment target. In the current review, several aspects of the 
      participation of MEG3 in carcinogenesis are discussed.

TI  - MEG3: an Oncogenic Long Non-coding RNA in Different Cancers.
PG  - 859-874
LID - 10.1007/s12253-019-00614-3 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently considered as central regulators in 
      diverse biological processes and emerged as vital players controlling tumorigenesis. 
      Several lncRNAs can be classified into oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes 
      depending on their function in cancer. A maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) gene 
      transcripts a 1.6 kb lncRNA whose act as an antitumor component in different cancer 
      cells, such as breast, liver, glioma, colorectal, cervical, gastric, lung, ovarian 
      and osteosarcoma cancer cells. The present review highlights biological function of 
      MEG3 to repress tumor through regulating the major tumor suppressor genes p53 and 
      Rb, inhibiting angiogenesis-related factor, or controlling miRNAs. On the other 
      hand, previous studies have also suggested that MEG3 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT). However, deregulation of MEG3 is associated with the  development 
      and progression of cancer, suggesting that MEG3 may function as a potential 
      biomarker and therapeutic target for human cancers.

TI  - Long non-coding RNAs in ischemic stroke.

LID - 281
AB  - Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. 
      Uncovering the cellular and molecular pathophysiological processes in stroke have 
      been a top priority. Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs play critical roles in different 
      kinds of diseases. In recent years, a bulk of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs have been 
      screened out in ischemic stroke patients or ischemia insulted animals using new 
      technologies such as RNA-seq, deep sequencing, and microarrays. Nine specific 
      lncRNAs, antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), metastasis-associate 
      lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), N1LR, maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), 
      H19, CaMK2D-associated transcript 1 (C2dat1), Fos downstream transcript (FosDT), 
      small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14), and taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1), 
      were found increased in cerebral ischemic animals and/or oxygen-glucose deprived 
      (OGD) cells. These lncRNAs were suggested to promote cell apoptosis, angiogenesis, 
      inflammation, and cell death. Our Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis predicted 
      that MEG3, H19, and MALAT1 might also be related to functions such as neurogenesis, 
      angiogenesis, and inflammation through mechanisms of gene regulation (DNA 
      transcription, RNA folding, methylation, and gene imprinting). This knowledge may 
      provide a better understanding of the functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs in 
      ischemic stroke. Further elucidating the functions and mechanisms of these lncRNAs 
      in biological systems under normal and pathological conditions may lead to 
      opportunities for identifying biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets of ischemic 
      stroke.

TI  - The Roles and Mechanisms of lncRNAs in Liver Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21041482 [doi]
LID - 1482
AB  - Many studies have revealed that circulating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate 
      gene and protein expression in the process of hepatic fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is a 
      reversible wound healing response followed by excessive extracellular matrix 
      accumulation. In the development of liver fibrosis, some lncRNAs regulate diverse 
      cellular processes by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and binding 
      proteins. Previous investigations demonstrated that overexpression of lncRNAs such 
      as H19, maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), growth arrest-specific transcript 5 
      (GAS5), Gm5091, NR_002155.1, and HIF 1alpha-antisense RNA 1 (HIF1A-AS1) can inhibit 
      the progression of liver fibrosis. Furthermore, the upregulation of several lncRNAs 
      [e.g., nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), hox transcript antisense 
      RNA (Hotair), and liver-enriched fibrosis-associated lncRNA1 (lnc-LFAR1)] has been 
      reported to promote liver fibrosis. This review will focus on the functions and 
      mechanisms of lncRNAs, the lncRNA transcriptome profile of liver fibrosis, and the 
      main lncRNAs involved in the signalling pathways that regulate hepatic fibrosis. 
      This review provides insight into the screening of therapeutic and diagnostic 
      markers of liver fibrosis.

TI  - Long non-coding RNAs: From disease code to drug role.
PG  - 340-354
LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2020.10.001 [doi]
AB  - Enormous studies have corroborated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) extensively 
      participate in crucial physiological processes such as metabolism and immunity, and 
      are closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors, cardiovascular 
      diseases, nervous system disorders, nephropathy, and other diseases. The application 
      of lncRNAs as biomarkers or intervention targets can provide new insights into the 
      diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This paper has focused on the emerging research 
      into lncRNAs as pharmacological targets and has reviewed the transition of lncRNAs 
      from the role of disease coding to acting as drug candidates, including the current 
      status and progress in preclinical research. Cutting-edge strategies for lncRNA 
      modulation have been summarized, including the sources of lncRNA-related drugs, such 
      as genetic technology and small-molecule compounds, and related delivery methods. 
      The current progress of clinical trials of lncRNA-targeting drugs is also discussed. 
      This information will form a latest updated reference for research and development 
      of lncRNA-based drugs.

AB  - Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that coordinates 
      a diverse array of cellular processes requiring epigenetic regulation of genes and 
      interactions with key signaling proteins and by acting as a competitive endogenous 
      (ce)RNA. Epigenetic modifications driven by in utero nutrition affect MEG3 
      expression and its role in the development of multiple metabolic disorders. This 
      review examines how epigenetic modification of MEG3 expression can confer 
      adaptedness to different metabolic environments. To this end, we discuss how 
      nutritional status that leads to an increase of MEG3 expression can protect against 
      cancer and metabolic dysfunctions, while interventions that promote MEG3 
      downregulation minimize the pleiotropic costs associated with its expression. 
      Lastly, we identify research directions that would further shed light on the role of 
      MEG3 in metabolic regulation and in functional imprinted gene networks. This article 
      is part of a Special Issue entitled: ncRNA in control of gene expression edited by

AB  - BACKGROUND Dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in 
      periodontitis development. Nevertheless, the role and mechanism of lncRNA 
      maternally-expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in periodontitis progression remain unclear. This 
      study aimed to explore how and whether MEG3 affect viability, apoptosis, and 
      inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated periodontal ligament cells 
      (PDLCs). MATERIAL AND METHODS Periodontal ligament tissues were collected from 
      periodontitis patients or normal individuals. PDLCs were obtained from normal 
      periodontal ligament and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced PDLCs 
      injury was assessed via viability, apoptosis and inflammatory response using Cell 
      Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. The levels of MEG3 
      and microRNA (miR)-143-3p were examined via quantitative reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction. The protein kinase B(AKT)/inhibitory kappaB kinase (IKK) 
      pathway was analyzed via Western blot. The target correlation of MEG3 and miR-143-3p 
      was determined through dual-luciferase reporter analysis. RESULTS MEG3 level was 
      decreased and miR-143-3p level was upregulated in periodontitis and LPS-treated 
      PDLCs. MEG3 overexpression or miR-143-3p knockdown alleviated LPS-induced viability 
      inhibition, apoptosis promotion, and inflammatory response. MEG3 was a sponge for 
      miR-143-3p. miR-143-3p overexpression weakened the effect of MEG3 on LPS-induced 
      injury. MEG3 overexpression inhibited the activation of AKT/IKK pathway by sponging 
      miR-143-3p in LPS-treated PDLCs. CONCLUSIONS MEG3 overexpression inhibited 
      LPS-induced injury in PDLCs by inactivating the AKT/IKK pathway via sponging 
      miR-143-3p, providing a potential target for treatment of periodontitis.

AB  - The imprinted delta like 1 homolog (DLK1) - thyroxine deiodinase type III (DIO3) 
      locus regulates development and growth. Its imprinting regulation involves two 
      differentially methylated regions (DMRs), intergenic-DMR (IG-DMR) and maternally 
      expressed gene 3-DMR (Meg3-DMR). In mice, a maternal deletion of the IG-DMR leads to 
      LOI in the locus, proving that the IG-DMR is a cis-acting imprinting control region 
      of the locus. However, the Meg3-DMR overlaps with the promoter, exon 1 and intron 1 
      of the Meg3 gene. Because deletion of the Meg3-DMR inactivates the Meg3 gene, their 
      roles in imprinting regulation of Meg3-DMR mice is unknown. Therefore, we generated 
      two mouse models: Meg3(Δ(1-4)) and Meg3(Δ(2-4)), respectively targeting exons 1-4 
      and exons 2-4 of the Meg3 gene. A maternal deletion of Meg3(Δ(1-4)) caused embryonic 
      death and LOI in both embryos and placentas, but did not affect methylation status 
      of the IG-DMR. In contrast, mice carrying a maternal deletion of Meg3(Δ(2-4)) were 
      born normally and did not have LOI. These data indicate that it is the Meg3-DMR, not 
      the Meg3 gene, which regulates imprinting of the Dlk1-Dio3 locus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inflammasome contributes to ischemic brain injury by inducing pyroptosis 
      and inflammation. The aim of this study is to unravel the mechanism of long 
      non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3)-mediated regulation of 
      absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). 
      METHODS: In vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model and in vitro 
      oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-treated neurocytes model were 
      generated. TTC, H&E staining and TUNEL were performed to assess the cerebral 
      ischemic injury. LDH and MTT assays were used to detect cell viability and 
      cytotoxicity. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression levels of MEG3, miR-485 and 
      AIM2. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence were conducted to detect the 
      AIM2 expression. ELISA and Western blotting were performed to determine the 
      secretion and protein levels of inflammasome signaling proteins. Dual luciferase 
      reporter assay and Ago2-RIP were used to validate the direct interaction among MEG3, 
      miR-485 and AIM2. RESULTS: In both MCAO rats and OGD/R-treated neurocytes, MEG3 and 
      AIM2 were significantly up-regulated, whereas miR-485 was down-regulated. MCAO 
      induces pyroptosis and release of IL-1β and IL-18 in ischemia brain. MEG3 acted as a 
      molecular sponge to suppress miR-485, and AIM2 was identified as a direct target of 
      miR-485. Knockdown of MEG3 inhibited OGD/R-induced pyroptosis and inflammation, and 
      lack of MEG3 inhibited caspase1 signaling and decreased the expression of AIM2, ASC, 
      cleaved-caspase1 and GSDMD-N. While overexpression of MEG3 exerted opposite effects. 
      CONCLUSION: MEG3/miR-485/AIM2 axis contributes to pyroptosis via activating caspase1 
      signaling during cerebral I/R, suggesting that this axis may be a potent therapeutic 
      target in ischemic stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Out of 3 billion base pairs in human genome only ~2% code for proteins; 
      and out of 180,000 transcripts in human cells, about 20,000 code for protein, 
      remaining 160,000 are non-coding transcripts. Most of these transcripts are more 
      than 200 base pairs and constitute a group of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Many of 
      the lncRNA have its own promoter, and are well conserved in mammals. Accumulating 
      evidence indicates that lncRNAs act as molecular switches in cellular 
      differentiation, movement, apoptosis, and in the reprogramming of cell states by 
      altering gene expression patterns. However, the role of this important group of 
      molecules in angiogenesis is not well understood. Angiogenesis is a complex process 
      and depends on precise regulation of gene expression. CONCLUSION: Dysregulation of 
      transcription during this process may lead to several diseases including various 
      cancers. As angiogenesis is an important process in cancer pathogenesis and 
      treatment, lncRNA may be playing an important role in angiogenesis. In support of 
      this, lncRNA microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (MVIH) has been 
      shown to activate angiogenesis. Furthermore, lncRNA-Meg3-knockout mouse showed 
      increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor pathway genes and 
      increased cortical microvessel density. Overall, there is strong evidence that 
      lncRNA is an important class of regulatory molecule, and a number of studies have 
      demonstrated that these can be targeted to change cellular physiology and functions. 
      In this review, we have attempted to summarize these studies and elucidate the 
      potential of this novel regulatory molecule as a therapeutic target.
